# VPC-Traffic-Flow-and-Security
What is Amazon VPC?

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud gives you full control over your virtual
networking environment, including resource placement, connectivity, and
security. VPCs provide more precise control over the cloud network, which
can enhance data and security.

How I used Amazon VPC in this project

Intoday's project, I implemented asecure AWS VPC withpublic and private
subnets, configured an Internet Gateway and set up Security Groups and
Network ACLs for traffic control.
